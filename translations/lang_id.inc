"Learning the basics" => "1446",
"The major difference between Omaha Poker rules and Texas Hold\'em is that instead of two hole cards as in Hold\'em, players receive four private cards placed face down (aka: the pocket)" => "1447",
"Omaha Poker rules dictate that the hand at the showdown must be created from only two of the four pocket cards and three community cards" => "1448",
"This final hand rule makes it easier for players to make a better hand since they get to choose from nine cards instead of seven" => "1449",
"There is another version of the game called Omaha Hi Lo which has slightly different requirements" => "1450",
"Starting Omaha Poker - The Blinds" => "1451",
"The blinds are forced bets placed by two players seated to the immediate left of the dealer at the beginning of each hand. Exactly as in Texas Holdem, the blinds are posted before any cards are dealt" => "1452",
"The Small Blind, placed by the player who sits directly to the left of the dealer, is 50% of the small stake (in fixed-limit games), and the Big Blind, placed by the player who sits directly to the left of the Small Blind, is 100% of the small stake. The Blinds are used as an incentive for players to sweeten the pot" => "1453",
"Step by Step Omaha Poker Rules" => "1454",
"After the Blinds are posted, each participating player receives four cards face down to his pocket. The first player to act is the one seated to the immediate left to the Big Blind. He can either call,raise or fold as he wishes. A betting round is held. In fixed limit games, the first two betting rounds use the lower game stake for all raises" => "1455",
"The Flop" => "1456",
"The dealer deals three cards to the middle of the table face up., known as \'the Flop.\' Next, everyone makes their bets. This betting round still uses the low game stake for all raises and bets. For instance, in a 2/4 game, the lower stake amount is, of course, 2" => "1457",
"The \'Turn\'" => "1458",

Each of these rounds is described below in a separate section.<br/>To start the hand, the deck is shuffled, the blinds are posted and each player is dealt two cards face down, his hole cards. There is a round of betting that is limited to one bet and three raises (in limit games).<br/>When this first round of betting action is complete the dealer will place three cards face up on the table. These three cards are called the flop. All cards dealt face-up on the table are community cards. That means that they \'belong\' to all players and may be used by any player in any combination with his hole cards to make his best possible poker hand" => "1538",

The advantage is that players in a late position get to act after players in earlier positions and thus have information about the other players\' intentions.

The action pointer indicates that the player Gilbert is next to act.
