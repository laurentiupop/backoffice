"Learning the basics" => "<content id='1446' />",
"The major difference between Omaha Poker rules and Texas Hold\'em is that instead of two hole cards as in Hold\'em, players receive four private cards placed face down (aka: the pocket)" => "<content id='1447' />",
"Omaha Poker rules dictate that the hand at the showdown must be created from only two of the four pocket cards and three community cards" => "<content id='1448' />",
"This final hand rule makes it easier for players to make a better hand since they get to choose from nine cards instead of seven" => "<content id='1449' />",
"There is another version of the game called Omaha Hi Lo which has slightly different requirements" => "<content id='1450' />",
"Starting Omaha Poker - The Blinds" => "<content id='1451' />",
"The blinds are forced bets placed by two players seated to the immediate left of the dealer at the beginning of each hand. Exactly as in Texas Holdem, the blinds are posted before any cards are dealt" => "<content id='1452' />",
"The Small Blind, placed by the player who sits directly to the left of the dealer, is 50% of the small stake (in fixed-limit games), and the Big Blind, placed by the player who sits directly to the left of the Small Blind, is 100% of the small stake. The Blinds are used as an incentive for players to sweeten the pot" => "<content id='1453' />",
"Step by Step Omaha Poker Rules" => "<content id='1454' />",
"After the Blinds are posted, each participating player receives four cards face down to his pocket. The first player to act is the one seated to the immediate left to the Big Blind. He can either call,raise or fold as he wishes. A betting round is held. In fixed limit games, the first two betting rounds use the lower game stake for all raises" => "<content id='1455' />",
"The Flop" => "<content id='1456' />",
"The dealer deals three cards to the middle of the table face up., known as \'the Flop.\' Next, everyone makes their bets. This betting round still uses the low game stake for all raises and bets. For instance, in a 2/4 game, the lower stake amount is, of course, 2" => "<content id='1457' />",

The advantage is that players in a late position get to act after players in earlier positions and thus have information about the other players\' intentions.

                a 100 % bet on Milan with a 2,00 quote: if Milan wins you\'ll win 100 % multiplied with the 2,00 quote = 200 %<br />
